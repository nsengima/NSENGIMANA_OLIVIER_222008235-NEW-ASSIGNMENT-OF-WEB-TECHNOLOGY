<h1>SYSTEM ENGINEERING DATABASE AND JAVA CODE OF ONLINE TAILOR MANAGEMENT SYUSTEM</h1>
	<ol><h2><u><li>CHAPTER1:SYSTEM ENGINEERING</li></u></h2>
		<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
		<P>Online tailoring management system is a system aimed to assist in management of tailoring 
activities within the industry. It will provide online services to customers such as: measurement 
submission to their tailors, check whether their garments are finished and also help in proper 
keeping of records.This will ensure availability of right information, information safety, easy 
storage, access and retrieval.</P>
<P>.The study aims at building a computerized tailoring management system that would be more 
effective and efficient than the existing manual system.</P>

<P>2.Statement of the problem </P>
<P>. Considering the above section, there are many problems associated with the existing manual 
system, they include the following:</P><P>
• Duplication in records of the customers.</P><P> 
• There is a problem of storage of the taken measurements i.e. can easily get lost.</P><P> 
• Information retrieval from these sources is not easy</P>
<P>2.1	Description of the existing system
The existing system was found to be completely manual, i.e. customers’ information is captured 
in books, there also required to walk to the tailor shop to get their measurements taken.</P><P> 
Customers also go to the tailor shops to check on the progress of their garments.</P>

<P>2.2 Problems of the current system </P>
<P>Currently customers have to walk to the tailor shops to get their measurements taken for the 
tailoring of their garments. </P><P> Their details are taken and kept on papers. Customers too need to 
move from their offices to go and check for the clothes whether there complete or not. This is 
time consuming and costly.</P><P>  Due to the manual systems in use, the whole process tends to be 
slow.</P><P>  Customers too have no prior information on cost of netting their garments.</P>
<P>2.3 How the proposed system will work</P>
<P>The Online Tailoring Management System will permit to register and deliver measurements to 
the tailor for the next process to follow. 
It also maintains clients’ information and generating various reports about the tailor shop. The 
main users of the project are clients and system Administrator.
It also enables customers to check the status of their garments i.e. if ready or not for collection.
The system provides information about the cost, the fabric type the customer want his/her dress 
knit from, the duration a customer wants the dress finished, the type of material to be used, 
quantity in terms of pairs needed and most importantly, the system computes the total cost and 
avails that information to the customer.
However, online payment has not been achieved,but the customer is expected to pay either via 
mobile money transfer services like m-pesa, pesapal or cash when they come to pick their 
clothes</P>

<P>1.4	Describe other alternatives</P>

3.	DATA FLOW DIAGRAM (LEVEL 0, LEVEL 1)</p><p>
Data flow diagrams (DFDs) were used to illustrate the flow of information in a system.
They are hardware independent and do not reflect decision points. They demonstrate the 
information and how it flows between specific processes in a system. They provide one kind of 
documentation for reports. These diagrams help to show how data moves and changes through 
the system in a graphical top-down fashion. They also help to give graphical representation of 
the system’s components, processes and the interfaces between them.
When it came to conveying how data flows through systems (and how that data was transformed 
in the process), DFDs were the method of choice over technical descriptions for three principal 
reasons:</p><P>
•	DFDs are easier to understand by technical and non-technical audiences.</P><p>
•	They provide a high-level system overview, complete with boundaries and connections to 
other systems.</p><p>
•	They provide a detailed representation of the system components.</p><P>
The diagram below shows the flow of data through the proposed system. It depicts the flow of 
information and the transformation that is applied as data moves from input to output
This figure defines the boundary between the system, or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it, this diagram is a high level view of a system. 
A Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) provides a high-level overview of the system and its major processes. It represents the interactions between external entities and the system as a single process. Here is an example of a Level 0 DFD for a tailor booking management system:</P><p>

6.	Description of the selected Process Model</P><P>
                                            Waterfall Model</P><P>
It is comprised of the stages that the developer will use when developing the system. It is a 
sequential model hence the name waterfall. The developer has to finish with one stage before 
going to the next one. It comprises of the feasibility study, analysis phase, design phase, coding 
phase, testing phase, implementation phase and finally the maintenance phase. It is a simple 
model and easy to use and understand. With waterfall development based methodologies, the 
analysts and users proceed sequentially from one phase to the next. The deliverables from each 
phase are voluminous and are presented to the project sponsor for approval as the project moves 
from phase to phase. Once the phase is approved by the sponsor it ends and the next phase 
begins. </P><P>

6.1	Cause of your selection</P><P>
The waterfall model is a sequential software development process that follows a linear and systematic approach. It consists of distinct phases, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The key reasons for using the waterfall model are:</P><P>

Simplicity: The waterfall model is straightforward and easy to understand. Its linear nature allows for a clear progression from one phase to another, making it ideal for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.</P><P>

Clear Documentation: Each phase in the waterfall model requires detailed documentation before moving to the next phase. This documentation ensures that all requirements, designs, and test plans are thoroughly documented, which can be beneficial for future reference and maintenance.</P><P>

Project Planning and Management: The waterfall model allows for better project planning and management as each phase has specific deliverables and milestones. This enables project managers to estimate project timelines, allocate resources, and monitor progress more effectively.</P><P>

Early Detection of Issues: The waterfall model emphasizes completing each phase before moving on to the next. This sequential approach allows for early detection and resolution of issues within each phase, minimizing the risk of problems being carried over to subsequent phases.</P><P>

Well-defined Requirements: The waterfall model works well when the requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change significantly during the project. It is particularly suitable for projects with stable and predetermined objectives.</P><P>

Client and Stakeholder Involvement: The waterfall model allows clients and stakeholders to have a clear understanding of the project's progress and milestones. Their involvement is typically more prominent during the early phases, such as requirements gathering and design, where they can provide valuable feedback and validation.</P><P>

Regulatory and Compliance Requirements: In certain industries, projects must adhere to strict regulatory and compliance requirements. The waterfall model's emphasis on documentation, traceability, and thorough testing can help ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.</P><P>

7.	Conclusion</P><P>
The online Tailoring system will ease the work of clients by allowing them to send their 
measurement online thus cutting on transport expenses and time. It will ease communication 
between the tailor and the client and also to access each other. 
It provides information about the cost, the fabric type the customer want his/her dress knit from, 
the urgency at which a customer wants the dress finished, the type of material to be used, 
quantity in terms of pairs needed and most importantly, the system computes the total cost and 
avails that information to the customer.
Therefore, this system will be more beneficial to implement.</P><P>

CHAPTER 3: JAVA PROGRAMING</P><P>
<b>Introduction.</b></P><P>
So a tailor Shop Management System is a software application designed to streamline and organize various aspects of running a tailor shop or clothing store.</P><P>
In this chapter I will be describing how powerful general purpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system.</P><P> Under this 
chapter I will explain in full all detail of how everything will function together with database 
that have been describe above and how it work with full analyzed system.</P><P>
Tools used to develop this system in java programming:</P><P>
Eclipse IDE: </P><P>an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It 
contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the 
environment. </P><P>It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development.</P><P>

JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and 
is used for aggregating many files into one.</P><P> Although JAR can be used as a general 
archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and 
their requisite components. </P><P>

 Let's explore the potential applications and functionalities of such a system:</P><P>
1.	Customer Management:</P><P>
•	The "Open Customer App" button likely opens a module for managing customer information.</P><P>
 </p><br><img src="main.jpg" width=900 height=500><br><br><br><br><br>
•	Features may include adding new customers, updating customer details, and keeping track of customer orders and preferences.</P><P>
2.	Appointment Management:</P><P>
•	The "Open Appointment App" button suggests a module for managing appointments.</P><P>
•	 
•	 </p><br><img src="appot.png" width=900 height=500><br><br><br><br><br>
•	This could include scheduling appointments for fittings or consultations with customers.</P><P>
3.	Billing and Invoicing:</P><P>
•	The "Open Billing App" button indicates a module for handling billing and invoicing.</P><P>
•	Features might include creating invoices for completed orders, tracking payments, and generating financial reports.</P><P>
•	 </p><br><img src="billing.png" width=900 height=300><br><br><br><br><br>
 
4.	Customer Summary and Viewing:</P><P>
•	The "Open Customer Summary App" and "Open Customer View App" buttons might provide summary views of customer information and individual customer profiles.</P><P>
•	This could include order history, measurements, and other relevant details.</P><P>
•	 
•	 </p><br><img src="cdisplay.jpg" width=950 height=800><br><br><br><br><br>
5.	Customer Deletion:</P><P>
•	The "Open Delete Customer App" button suggests a module for managing customer records, including the ability to delete customer profiles.</P><P>
•	 </p><br><img src="cdelete.jpg" width=950 height=540><br><br><br><br><br>
6.	Fabric and Inventory Management:</P><P>
•	The "Open Fabric View App" and "Open Inventory Item View App" buttons hint at modules for managing fabric inventory and other items.</P><P>
•	This may involve tracking available fabrics, accessories, and other inventory items.</P><P>
•	 </p><br><img src="fabric.jpg" width=960 height=570><br><br><br><br><br>
7.	Order Management:</P><P>
•	The "Open Order View App" button may lead to a module for tracking and managing customer orders.</P><P>
•	This could include order status, delivery dates, and other order-related information.</P><P>
•	 </p><br><img src="order.png" width=960 height=650><br><br><br><br><br>
8.	Staff Management:</P><P>
•	The "Open Staff View App" button may open a module for managing staff information.</P><P>
•	 </p><br><img src="staff.jpg" width=900 height=700><br><br><br><br><br>
•	This could include details about tailors, their work schedules, and other relevant personnel information.</P><P>
9.	Supplier Management:</P><P>
•	The "Open Supplier View App" button might open a module for managing relationships with fabric suppliers or other vendors.</P><P>
•	Features may include supplier contact information, order history, and inventory updates.</P><P>
•	 </p><br><img src="final.jpg" width=980 height=600><br><br><br><br><br>
10.	User-Friendly Interface:</P><P>
•	The entire application is built using Java's Swing library, providing a user-friendly Graphical User Interface for easy navigation and interaction.</P><P>
11.	Modular Design:</P><P>
•	The system follows a modular design, allowing each functionality to be encapsulated in separate modules or classes.</P><P>
•	This modular approach enhances maintainability and scalability.</P><P>
, a Tailor Shop Management System like this could significantly improve the efficiency of day-to-day operations in a tailor shop. It helps manage customer information, streamline appointments, keep track of inventory, and handle various other aspects of   the business in an organized and systematic manner. </P><P>
The Graphical User Interface provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system simply.</P>
